# dockwater
Docker images used across multiple repositories supporting simulation of water-related robotics

## Distributions
This repository supports baseline images for running Gazebo on the following ROS distributions:

* Jazzy (Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat / ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco / Gazebo Harmonic)
* Humble (Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish / ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill / Gazebo Garden)
* Galactic (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa / ROS 2 Galactic Geochelone / Ignition Fortress)
* Noetic (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa / ROS Noetic Ninjemys / Gazebo 11)
* Melodic (Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver / ROS Melodic Morenia / Gazebo 9)
* Kinetic (Ubuntu 18.04 Xenial Xerus / ROS Kinetic Kame / Gazebo 7)

## Dockerhub
The latest images corresponding to each of the three distributions above are stored in the [`npslearninglab/watery_robots` repository on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/npslearninglab/watery_robots).

## Build Instructions
Build the base image with the `build.bash` script.
```
DIST=(jazzy | humble | galactic | noetic | melodic | kinetic)
./build.bash ${DIST}
```
Run the image locally using the `run.bash` script:
```
./run.bash ${DIST}:latest
```

## Build for CI
To build an image for use in continuous integration pipelines, we need to use a slightly different `rocker` command from the one that's called in the `run.bash` script. The reason is to avoid pulling in local user information or mounting the local home directory.

```
rocker --dev-helpers --nvidia --user --user-override-name=developer ${image_name}
```
**Note**: The `--user-override-name` option is currently only available in the latest build (following the rocker [Development installation instructions](https://github.com/osrf/rocker#development)).

## Tag and push
The image resulting from the `rocker` command will be unnamed. To push to a repository, look up the ID with `docker image ls` and apply the appropriate tag:
```
docker tag <ID> <repository_namespace>/<repository>:<tag>
docker push <repository_namespace>/<repository>:<tag>
```
